Merciless Entropy (2021)

Installation, Master's thesis


This sculptural digital artwork is a monument to the fragile-yet-pervasive foundations of the Internet, and presents a new form of ruin aesthetics that are emerging from the modern Web.

Made of concrete casting, wires, and electronic parts scavenged from obsolete computers, it displays the results of a web crawler script searching for broken URLs, dead-end links, and other forms of ‘internet entropy’: the online wastelands of server errors and forgotten pages that litter the modern Web.  

It interrogates and confronts this ‘internet entropy’ as an often overlooked, and growing, part of the internet – a sprawling space that is  lost in the loop of higher internet speed, hardware improvements, ‘web bloat’, and planned obsolescence. 

Through the sculptural metaphor of architectural ruin, it is questioned what are the characteristics of digital decay in websites and how this is mirrored in the non-digital world, wondering how that desolate view - that both attracts and repels - can instigate alternate aesthetics that draw our attention to these phenomena, rather than hiding them from sight.
