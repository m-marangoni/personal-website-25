Overflowing Gardens of Decay (2021-24)

Web-art, scraper, poetry

The experimental web project takes the form of a website in five acts, each reflecting on different aspects of Internet decay, and what responses arise from the unexpected encounter with ruins and failure in the current web. The final result is a form of aestheticing and reflecting on those encounters with web decay through experimental poetry, visual art and audio to convey an immersive web-based interaction.

It was developed over the course of 3 months as part of my remote artistic residency at Nokturno.fi, a Finnish platform presenting digital and experimental poetry along other potential and unexplored forms of contemporary literature. 

In 2024, a second iteration of this project was commissioned to be exhibited at Ever Ending PLATFORM/POST, in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.
