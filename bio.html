<p> I am an artist and researcher based in London, currently a PhD student
at UAL Creative Computing Institute and a
Lecturer for MA Interaction Design at the London College of Communication.</p>
<p>My work focuses on critically examining digital
materiality and its socio-ecological implications
through a wide range of media such as
installations, web-based experiments and visual
poetry. Recent work has been focused on
reimagining computational paradigms for an
increasingly exhausted planet.</p>
<p>Amongst others, I have given talks and exhibited internationally at the Victoria and Albert Museum (UK), Rhizome.org, Ars Electronica (AT), Mesh Festival (CH), Transmediale (DE) and AMRO (AT).
