Titivillus (2023)                                 
Malware Art

Titivillus is an experimental desktop software written in bash that explores the creative potential of malware aesthethics and techniques. It simulates a demonic possession in your computer by the entity known as Titivillus, the medieval demon of scribes, which requires a sacrificial file ritual in order to be exorcized.
The project utilizes 'daemons', a term used to describe background processes performed by operating systems, as a metaphor for questioning agency, obfuscation, and authority in our daily relationship with digital devices.
It is part of the SFPC_Malware_Anthology.zip, a collection of work created during An Artist’s History of Computer Viruses and Malware, an online class at School For Poetic Computation taught by Todd Anderson and Herdimas Anggara.
