Critical Climate Computing Website (2024)

I was commissioned by the Critical Climate Computing Initiative (CCCI) to design and develop their main website and visual identity, grounded in low-carbon and critically engaged design frameworks.

Critical Climate Computing is a collective of artists, designers, and researchers at UAL exploring the entangled relations between computation and the climate crisis. The project develops new forms of computational art and design practice that centre responsibility, carbon and technological literacy, and critical creativity.
