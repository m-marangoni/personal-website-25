Nepenthe –from the Ancient Greek “drug of forgetfulness”

When we look back and try to retrace ancient steps in the endeavour of building a historical knowledge and narrative, we have to work with the clues, the remains of what once was. It a difficult puzzle, one could say even impossible to achieve in entirety. Until now, the vestiges of distant past were natural clues (fossils, soil marks, carbon prints), documents with written or pictorial work or ruins and objects that ended up surviving the long years. In the past 40 years or so there was a big movement towards digitalizing archives and documents, which now are mostly stored on cloud servers of tech giants. If we continue this trend and don’t rethink the way archiving works, plenty of our recent information today could be irremediably lost forever. 

This story is set in an anachronic, parallel world that mirrors our own in many ways. The events here are fictitious, but inspired by real happenings, concerns and tragedies. One of them was the Cesium-137 incident in 1987, Brazil. It was the second worst radioactive incident in the world outside of a power plant, but the local and federal government tried to supress its information for the large public, and are until now trying to erase evidences of it, renaming streets and public organs and building new places to force this disconnection with the past. Only the witness and victims remember, their pain stronger because they know they are being ignored, and that, once they are gone,  such event – that only occurred due to lack of basic education and government protection - could happen again.
