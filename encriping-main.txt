En-crip-ing Time (2024) with George Simms
Experimental Essay & Web-Based Performance

A collaboration with artist and researcher George Simms within the framework of MESH Festival 2024, contributing to a panel organized by the Make/Sense PhD program at the Basel Academy of Art and Design FHNW.

For this context, I developed an experimental essay that approaches code as performance, deliberately transgressing the conventions of academic writing. The work engages a crip critical perspective to challenge the rigid temporal logics embedded in computational imaginaries.

By performing cron jobs as chronic jobs, the piece reframes system maintenance as an act of crip care that resists chrononormativity. Its website/poem continually reveals and conceals lines of text as the en-crip-tion algorithm runs, producing a fluctuating digital surface that performs its own temporal politics.

The essay was published in Brand-New-Life, a magazine for art criticism, and can be accessed here:
