Compost Computer: More-Than Human Design through Critical Climate Computing (2025 - ongoing)
UAL’s Critical Climate Computing Initiative (CCCI)

In collaboration with Shinji Toya
Project Leaders: Eva Verhoeven and Wesley Goatley 


As the carbon footprint of computation grows ever more urgent, there is a pressing need to rethink what it means to design technology responsibly. This project takes a more-than-human approach, treating digital systems not as isolated tools, but as nodes entangled within ecological, social, and material networks. Technology, climate, and design are inseparable, and it is precisely in their intersections that new possibilities emerge.

As one of the main researchers involved in the project, The Critical Climate Computing Initiative (CCCI) in collaboration with FutureEverything,MUD, and Sow the City, a local permaculture collective, has constructed a proof-of-concept Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) server fed with Platt Fields compost. This process is not merely about efficiency; it is about cultivating attentiveness to the material consequences of our digital infrastructures, and to the ethical and ecological responsibilities embedded in every pixel and circuit.

Through this work, we seek to demonstrate how cross-sector collaborations, rooted in community knowledge and ecological practice, can expand the imagination of what digital design might be. The resulting platform will be both a working demonstration of a biobattery-powered server and a critical experiment in climate-conscious computational approaches.

A content-aware image editing tool was also developed for this project, seeking to reduce Future Everything's image archives' file size by averaging pixels and mapping them to a compact color palette, preserving detail in key areas while compressing simpler regions. Tool available here:
